===============================================================================

Installing
----------
TigerLily requires Perl 5.003 or greater.  You will also need
Curses.pm or Term::Readline::Gnu. (from CPAN)

You can run tlily directly from the source directory, by running
"perl tlily.PL".

To create an assortment of single file versions of tlily, run:

perl Makefile.PL
make

Pick the .plx you want to use (depends on the UI you wish to use, it's part
of the file name), and copy it wherever you wish.

To do a standard installation:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make install

And "tlily" will be installed in the directory you specify during the first
step.


Colors
------

Color preferences are specified in the config files(See 'Configuration'
below).  To change a color, set that color preference in your site or
user configuration files.  Color preferences are in %color_attrs, and
monochrome preferences are in %mono_attrs.

Example:  To make the header on private messages red on white instead of
green on black, add the following to your config file:

    %color_attrs = ('public_header' => [qw(red     white   normal)]);


/-command Overrides
-------------------

Tigerlily includes several client-side fixes/enhancements for existing lily
commmands, implemented by intercepting the command before it is sent
to the server:

/info		Enhanced so that /info set and /info edit bring up your
		editor for you to change your info.

/memo		Enhanced so that /memo set and /memo edit bring up your
		editor for you to change your memos.

/blurb          Enhanced so that /blurb will squeeze your requested blurb
                into the space available.

/oops		Fixed so as to reset your sendlist correctly for ;-expansion

/also		Fixed so as to append the /also'ed people to your sendlist
		for ;-expansion.


To allow any of these overrides, put the command without the / in the
@slash variable in your site or user configuration files.

Example: To enable the /info override, add the following to your 
	 user or site config files:

@slash = ('info');

To disallow an override, put the command without the / and with a leading
'-' in the @slash variable in your site or user configuration files.

Example: To disable the /also override, add the following to your 
	 user or site config files:

@slash = ('-also');

Being concious not to override the existing behavior of lily commands, the
current default is to not override any /-commands.

There are those among the developers that want to change this default,
though, and so this default may change.


Configuration (Needs expanding)
-------------

TigerLily now has 4 levels of customization:
    Level    Default File Location
             Description
    -----    ---------------------
    Global   /usr/local/lib/tlily/tlily.cf
             Default settings for all features; please no not edit except
             when developing to add defaults for new settings.
    Site     /usr/local/etc/tlily.cf
             Site-specific settings to augment or override the global
             settings.  System Administrators wishing to change the
             default settings for their users should edit this file.
    User     ~/.lily/tlily/tlily.cf
             User-specific settings to override the global and site
             settings.
    Command  <no file>
             Many(not all) configuration options can be overridden at the
             command line.

The format for these .cf files is

[$@%]<config_var> = <value> ;

So, to set your browser to lynx, you'd add the following lines to 
~/.lily/tlily/tlily.cf:

$browser=lynx;
$browser_textmode=1;

Note that in an interactive session, this would be accomplished with:

%set browser lynx

Here is a summary of some common configuration file (CF) options:

@load
	Setting this variable in a CF will change the list of
	extensions to load.  An extension preceeded by a - will
	cause that extension to not be loaded.  
	    # Example:
	    @load = ('a', 'b', '-c', 'd', '-e');
	    # In addition to the current extension list, extensions a, b,
	    # and d will be loaded, and extensions c and e will not be loaded.
	The default extension list is in the global CF, and can be
	changed using this method in the site and/or user CFs.

%color_attrs
%mono_attrs
	Setting elements of these hashes in a cf will change the color
	settings for the color and monochrome mode of an element.

@slash
	Setting this variable will change the list of /-commands that are
	allowed to be intercepted by tlily and other extensions in order
	to add functionality to an existing command.  Any extension wanting
	to intercept a /-command must honor their desired command's
	existence/non-existence in this list.  Adding a /-command to this
	list will not necessarily enable interception of the /-command;
	the extension that wants to intercept it must be loaded also.
	    # Example:
	    @slash = ('-info', 'also', 'oops');
	    # In addition to the slash list from previous CF levels,
	    # allow /also and /oops to be intercepted, but do not
	    # allow /info to be overridden.
	By default, no slash commands will be allowed to be intercepted.  This
	can be overridden in the site and/or user CFs using this method.

$emote_oops
        If set, this specifies an oops string to use for emote discussions.
        The standard lily /oops will still be used for connect discs.  Note
        that this only effects %oops -- you will need to add oops to @slash
        to change /oops.

@prefer
        This variable contains a list of destinations to "prefer" when
        doing autoexpansion.  If a partial destination is a prefix to
        an element in this list, it will always be expanded to it.
        Examples:
          @prefer = ('-security');
          The "security" discussion exists, as does the user "Secret Agent".
          "sec" will expand to "-security".

          @prefer = ('damien_clone');
          The users "damien" and "damien clone" both exist.
          "dam" will expand to "damien_clone".  "damien" exactly matches
          a user, and will not expand.
	
%bindings
        Set %bindings to install global key bindings.  For example:
                %bindings = { 'M-g' => 'look' };
        or
                $bindings{'M-g'} = 'look';
        will both set the M-g key to do the "look" function, which
        provides a simple lookup mechanism to the Unix "words" file.
        (Note that the look function is bound to C-g by default, and
        %bindings does not change that.)  Bindings set this way will
        be available before you are even connected to the server,
        which can't be accomplished by using %bind in a Startup file/memo.

Extensions can each have options to configure them; see the documentation
for the specific module to see what options can be set.


Subversion access
-----------------
The TigerLily sources are stored in a Subversion repository.  Anyone working
on TigerLily development can get access by contacting Damien (neild@misago.org)
or Albert (albert@acm.rpi.edu).  We also allow anonymous read-only access.

You can find Subversion at subversion.tigris.org.  In addition to the
source code, you will also find links to precompiled Windows clients,
such as TortoiseSVN.

The repository is currently located on svn.tlily.org.

To access the repository anonymous read-only, do:
  svn co http://svn.tlily.org/svn/tlily/trunk tlily
Which will get you the most recent development version.

To access the repository read-write, once you have an account, do:
  svn co svn+ssh://svn.tlily.org/data/svn/tlily/trunk tlily

If your local login name is not the same as on svn.tlily.org, you will
need to add a --username to that commandline as appropriate.

Subversion has built-in help, accessible from "svn help".  The commands
are very similar to basic CVS commands, and in some cases, more intuitive.

The important svn commands are:
  - svn co <URL> [<PATH>]
    This will grab the latest copy of the sources from the subversion
    repository located at <URL> (see above for the tlily repository URL).

    If <PATH> is given, the checkout will be placed in that directory,
    creating the directory if necessary.  If <PATH> is omitted, the last
    directory name in the repository URL will be used as the name of a
    directory in your current working directory into which svn will do
    the checkout.

    No locking is implied by this operation; you may delete the checked
    out tree without ill effect.

  - svn update
    Compares a checked out tree to the current sources, merging down any
    changed files from the repository into your checked out copy.  Does
    not change the repository.

  - svn add <PATH>
  - svn remove <PATH>
  - svn move <PATH> <NEWPATH>
  - svn copy <PATH> <NEWPATH>
    These commands cover the addition of a new file/directory into the
    repository, removing a file/directory from the repository, and renaming
    or copying a file/directory from one place to another.  Any changes you
    make will be visible to others only after you run svn commit.

  - svn commit [<PATH>]
    Checks in all changes in the specified path (or current directory, if
    no path is specified).

  - svn diff [<PATH>]
    Compares a checked out file/path (or current directory) against the
    repository, outputting a diff-like listing of changes.

  - svn status [<PATH>]
    Compares a checked out file/path (or current directory) against the
    repository, outputting a summary of what files have changed.
